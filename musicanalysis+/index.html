                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever listened to an awesome song, but not understood a word of it? Or have you heard the lyrics of a song, but didn’t really understand the underlying meaning? Welcome to Resonate, a little music analysis site made by yours truly. Here I pick songs and analyze them, because I want to. I discovered that analyzing song lyrics is something I’m both capable of and enjoy doing, so here we are. However, I am by no-means a professional, so please don’t take my word as law, and I may even sometimes take inspiration from other more renowned analyses/analysis sites. This is moreso just a personal project for myself, but also put online for others to potentially enjoy as well.
                </p>
                <h2>Organization</h2>
                <p>
                    How will this be organized? I hope to separate songs by types and origins. Video game songs will be separated from non-video game, and each of these will have their own individual sections. Songs within the former type will be separated by game, and songs in the latter will be split-up by genre. (Though I currently only have immediate plans for game songs, it’s good to prepare for the future.)
                </p>
                <h2>What sorts of music will I analyze?</h2>
                <p>
                    Anything I’m interested in, though my current main objective is the Persona 3 Reload’s soundtrack (see details below). I am also interested in looking at some of Theophany’s Majora’s Mask tracks (they are absolutely amazing if you haven’t listened to them). Non-lyrical songs will obviously be analyzed differently, but it could still be fun. I may branch out to other popular songs too if it so strikes my fancy. (The new Epic: The Musical’s soundtrack could be fun to analyze too, though I don’t have near enough knowledge about Greek Mythology. However, my friend does…)
                </p>
                <h2>What is my current project?</h2>
                <p>
                    More recently, I’ve taken a shine to Persona 3 Reload and its revamped soundtracks (this is what kinda sparked the whole idea, more about that below), so I may analyze those first (in context of the game). I have never actually played the game (though I do plan to), but I have learned quite a lot about it through YouTube and the internet as a whole. As I said before, please take my word with a grain of salt, as this is moreso something for personal fun as opposed to a professional’s work.
                </p>
                <h2>What about songs do I intend to analyze?</h2>
                <p>
                    The deeper meaning of songs’ lyrics, what analogies they use or what connections they create and what those connections bring, etc. I also hope to touch on or connect to the different english tools used (like poetry tools such as metaphors or personifications), and show how those english tools used create even deeper or more elaborate meaning. With non-lyrical songs (specifically Theophany’s), I may touch more on the instruments’ or melodies’ meanings.
                </p>
                <h2>How did this start?</h2>
                <p>
                    I actually kinda discovered my enjoyment of song or poetry analysis a long time ago. I did exceptionally well on a related school assignment, though I didn’t pursue this at the time. Much more recently I got drawn into Persona 3 Reload and its stunning music. I rambled about multiple songs and their lyrics to my friend, and talked about their neat meanings and connections to my friend. (I ended up writing multiple mini-essays in the process). She later pointed out that this could be turned into a website, and so that is what I am doing now. :)
