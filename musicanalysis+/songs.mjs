                `Right off the bat, this song uses Repetition, a literary device that can be used to emphasize a certain phrase, and/or show its importance. Repetition can also be used to help convince an audience of the repeated thing, or perhaps in this case our protagonist.`,
                
                `So, what does “burn my dread” mean?`,
                
                `The phrase “burn my dread” references the original Persona 3’s opening song (this was its title). That song (from what I could tell) was generally about Makoto previously being afraid of death, before breaking free of that fear and striving to live life to the fullest or without regrets. It also touches on his and SEES’ situation as a whole.`,
                
                `Along with this, “dread” as a verb means “to anticipate with great apprehension or fear”, or “to feel extreme reluctance to meet or face.” Given that “burn” essentially means ‘to destroy with fire,’ I think the phrase “burn my dread” means “destroy my fear and apprehension of death.”`,

                `(And when I say “fear of death,” I think this can refer to both the fear of dying yourself, and the fear of losing others to death).`,
                
                `All of this is to say, this repetition of the phrase “burn my dread” (both here and throughout the song) is to put emphasis on and show the importance of destroying the fear of death (which is fitting given this aligns with the message of the game - accepting death as a part of life, and living despite it).`,
                
                `But since this song could be seen as Makoto’s thoughts and perspective, this repetition could also be showing how important it is that Makoto removes/removed his fear of death. Alternatively, it could be Makoto internally trying to convince himself he is no longer afraid of death. (Don’t you have times when you repeat a word or phrase to yourself to try and convince yourself of its truthfulness?)`
            ],
            [
                `“In your hearts…” the people Makoto’s referring to here are the main cast, the friends he made over the course of the game.`,
                
                `“Believing in me gave me possibilities”... Not only is Makoto physically/mentally strengthened by the support of his friends, but this also refers to his growth over the game. Through his friends Makoto left his apathy and started actually living. He gained the “possibilities” of life.`,

                `“It's more like a gift that I don't deserve”... The “gift” here is again the gift of life. Makoto initially made no effort to leave his apathetic state, and probably resisted leaving it at various points in the game, hence the “I don’t deserve”.`,

                `“So I gotta give it back to you by all means`,
                `By all means necessary”`,
                `This!!☝️☝️`,
                `Because his friends gave him life, he’s now going to give it back. Through Makoto’s friends he started truly living, instead of continuing the hollow shell of a life he lived before. So now, when his friends’ lives are on the line, Makoto’s going to give back his life, the life they gave him, so that they can keep living theirs. So that they can keep on living the life they taught him to love and value.`
